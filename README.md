This project implements a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing techniques. It includes:

  A Flask-based web application for sentiment analysis.
  Pre-trained machine learning model for predicting sentiment (positive or negative).
  Integration with HTML and CSS for user-friendly interaction.
The model utilizes techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and a supervised learning algorithm to classify text sentiments based on user input.
